# Examples

You'll want to read the documentation to gain an understanding of how Composer
works. That said, I hate reading docs and much prefer a good selection of
example code.

We'll start off basic and move into more complex territory.

- [A simple model/controller setup](examples/model-controller)  
Shows how to tie a model and controller together using eventing
- [A form in a controller](examples/controller-form)  
Use a controller to monitor form fields and update them into a model
- [A form in an xdom controller](examples/controller-xdom)  
Use an xdom controller to monitor form fields and update them into a model
with efficient re-rendering.
- [Simple TODO app](examples/todo)  
Take what we've learned and build a simple TODO app
- [Using the Router](examples/router)  
Use the router to switch "pages" in your app while maintaining state
- More to come!

<!--
