# Composer.js
Composer is a library for building complex single-page applications.

As of v1.1, Composer no longer requires any DOM frameworks to function. The only
dependency it has is [History.js](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/),
which is used by Composer.Router.

A special thanks to our early users who helped shape Composer in its infancy by
either reporting bugs or helping to write code!
